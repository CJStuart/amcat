          <p>
              Tasks are assignments which are processed in the background by <i>workers</i>. Workers
              are separate processes, thereby freeing up resources to the server handling other
              user requests. Task results are stored for a while (usually more than 24 hours), to allow
              users to, for example, shut down their computers while waiting for results.
          </p>
          <p>
              Tasks which are stuck in queue (due to some system failure) can be cleaned up by pressing
              'clean old tasks' above.
